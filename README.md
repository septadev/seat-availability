# Estimated Seat Availability
This dataset estimates the seat availability on SEPTA routes.

## Latest release
Latest version: [v202410270](https://github.com/septadev/seat-availability/releases/tag/v202410060), containing estimates for the week of October 27th, 2024.
These estimates are based on data collected from most bus routes, Regional Rail routes, subway/elevated routes, and the Norristown High Speed Line.

### Changes in this version:
* No changes in this version.

### Special notes:
* This version, like previous versions, has estimations for some bus routes but not all bus routes. This version does not contain estimations for some modes, routes, trips, and stops due to data availability. We expect to update existing estimations and to add estimations for additional routes in future versions.
* All bus, trolley, trackless trolley, NHSL, Subway/Elevated, and Regional Rail trips are included for completeness, but some have empty values in the "estimated_seat_availability_category" column, indicating no estimation is available.
